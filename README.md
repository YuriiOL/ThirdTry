How to use?

On first step you decide what picture you want to buy(at the bottom you can see the price). When you selected a picture, press the green button "Дале".
On second step you decide what border you want to buy(at the bottom you can see the price for picture and border). When you selected a border, press the green button "Дале".
On third step you decide what text you want in your picture. When you are ready, press the green button "Дале".
